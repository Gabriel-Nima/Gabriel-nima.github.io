excerpt: 'This in vitro study compared the accuracy of subtractive (milled PMMA) and additive (SLA, DLP) methods for interim tooth-supported restorations. Results showed comparable accuracy at the intaglio surface, but milled PMMA exhibited superior occlusal precision, reinforcing its role as the current standard.'
