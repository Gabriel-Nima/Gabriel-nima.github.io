Welcome
------
I am Gabriel Nima, a professor and researcher at Universidad de los Andes, Chile, working at the "Laboratorio de Biomateriales Dentales (BioMAD) within "Centro de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica" (CIIB), a biomedical research center. My research focuses on innovative solutions in dental materials, including antimicrobial therapies, photodynamic inactivation, and 3D printing applications. I have extensive experience in experimental design, microscopy techniques, microbiological assays, and publishing in high-impact peer-reviewed journals, as well as mentoring students and presenting at national and international scientific conferences.
Currently, my work aims to develop new strategies for cavity disinfection, dentin adhesion, and biofilm control. Here, you’ll find summaries of my publications, ongoing projects, and resources for students and collaborators interested in cutting-edge dental research.
