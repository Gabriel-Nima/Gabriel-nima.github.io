I am Gabriel Nima, a professor and researcher in Dental Materials at Universidad de los Andes, Chile. I work at the Dental Biomaterials Laboratory (BioMAD), part of the Centro de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica (CIIB), where my research integrates material science, microbiology, and clinical dentistry to develop innovative solutions for oral health.

## Current Focus

My academic and research activities combine laboratory experimentation, collaborative projects, and the translation of scientific knowledge into clinically relevant applications. My current work focuses on:

- Development and characterization of advanced dental biomaterials  
- Alternative antimicrobial therapies, including photodynamic inactivation and biofilm control strategies  
- Evaluation of CAD/CAM and 3D-printed materials for restorative dentistry  
- Optimization of polymerization, adhesion, and long-term durability of dental restorations  

These activities are carried out in collaboration with research groups in Chile, Peru, Brazil, and the United States.

## BioMAD – Dental Biomaterials Laboratory

BioMAD is dedicated to the design, characterization, and validation of dental biomaterials. The laboratory aims to bridge basic science and clinical challenges through:

- Mechanical, chemical, and optical characterization of materials  
- Microbiological models for biofilm evaluation  
- Assessment of emerging technologies in digital dentistry  

A dedicated laboratory page with ongoing projects and infrastructure details will be available soon.

## Collaboration and Opportunities

I actively collaborate with national and international researchers and welcome opportunities related to joint research projects, student supervision, technological development, and scientific consulting.
