I am an Assistant Professor (Profesor Asistente Ordinario) at Universidad de los Andes, Chile, and a researcher at the Dental Biomaterials Laboratory (BioMaD), within the Centro de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica (CiiB) of the same institution. I hold both a Master’s degree and a PhD in Dental Materials from Piracicaba Dental School at the University of Campinas (FOP-UNICAMP), Brazil.  
My research focuses on dental biomaterials, alternative antimicrobial therapies, and digital dentistry, with particular emphasis on antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, adhesion to dental tissues, polymerization behavior, and 3D-printed restorative materials. I teach at undergraduate and postgraduate programs and collaborate with research groups in Chile, Peru, Brazil, and the United States.  
More details about my academic background, research activities, and publications are available throughout this website.

## BioMAD – Dental Biomaterials Laboratory

BioMAD is dedicated to the design, characterization, and validation of dental biomaterials. The laboratory aims to bridge basic science and clinical challenges through:

- Mechanical, chemical, and optical characterization of materials  
- Microbiological models for biofilm evaluation  
- Assessment of emerging technologies in digital dentistry  

A dedicated laboratory page with ongoing projects and infrastructure details will be available soon.

## Collaboration and Opportunities

I actively collaborate with national and international researchers and welcome opportunities related to joint research projects, student supervision, technological development, and scientific consulting.
